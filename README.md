# Facial-Recognition
This program consists of 3 main scripts. The first detects a face from a video (can be modified to detect faces from imported still images) and creates a dataset for each face named by the user. The second script trains the chosen cascade classifier,  and the third launches a live video feed using an attached or native camera for real-time facial recognition, and includes the name of the recognized face and accuracy of match as a percentage.

Software Pre-requisites:
- Python 3 and various libraries such as os, glob, and NumPy
- OpenCV
